## K08: Tokens in the Stream
### Due: `2025-09-22m` 08:00


### GOAL:
a) Spread python proficiency among Devo Fam.
b) Increase proficiency with dictionaries and random selection of elements.
c) Gain experience parsing an input stream of alphanumeric characters by utilizing systematic token placement.

### TASK:
Step 0: Return to original seats/teams. Designate a driver and a scribe. Driver will drive the machine, scribe will enliven KtS as necessary, all teammates will think & discuss as necessary.

1. Review each teammates' last work:
   * one at a time
   * with all teammates watching, dialoguing
   * _and noting anything notable_
1. Procure starter kit. Save locally and tell github to track.
1. Configure directory in workshop, fit for submission. MMMC.
1. Develop and implement a python script that will...
   * read the given plaintext file
   * store these in 3 separate python dictionaries (UPDT: make username:duckyname key:value pairs)
   * then print the dictionaries, the criteria used to divide them, and a randomly selected pair from each group. This output should clearly indicate which tribe each selection came from.

#### Specifications/Guidelines:
* NOTE ANYTHING NOTABLE as you go. Retain your notes in DISCO&QCC section of readme
* github login required
* When posting to QAF, format code and/or terminal output as `code`
* Each run of your script should produce new random selections.
* Include proper heading.

##### DELIVERABLES:
* Section in readme for DISCOVERIES, QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS
* Section in readme entitled `NOTES FROM THE FIELD` wherein you mention anything gleaned from reviewing others' code and QAF posts today.
* Block comment in source code explaining how your re-formed team chose which code to "carry forward." Some common options:
  - Take one teammates' because it is clearly more robust, clear, well-documented.
  - Amalgamate all of your code, taking best portions of each, into new program.
  - After reviewing each other's work and finding it collectively subpar, scrapping it all and starting over as smarter, better-equipped Devos than the first time around...
* Block comment in source code explaining separation critera and approach.
* Block comment in source code explaining how your program sanitizes your data.
* Block comment in source code explaining how your program utilizes the tokens in the input stream to "make the data work for you."
* Identical source code and supporting files in each teammates' work repo, as shown below.
