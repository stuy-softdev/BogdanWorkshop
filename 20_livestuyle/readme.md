### Your cssTrio Mission: 

_Step 0: Establish team comms. Fetch KtS._

As a trio, refactor:
* a visit to your site should yield the same view/content as last work, but...
* ...it will be served by a live flask web server.

#### Specifications/Guidelines:
* *Never stray far from runnable code.* (keep your flask server running!)
* NOTE ANYTHING NOTABLE as you go.
* Use Q&A forum liberally.
* Comment liberally in-line. Speak to your future self and/or future teammates.
* Each teammate must be able to explain any aspect of your code.
* Include proper heading. Note team name and roster.
* *Simplicity is divine.*
