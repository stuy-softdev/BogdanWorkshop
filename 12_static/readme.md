## K12: Some Things Never Change
### Due: `2025-09-30t` 08:00
#Team: 1% of Gamblers
#Roster: Bogdan Sotnikov, Ethan Saldanha

# Running app.py creates a Flask local host that allows the running of all 
#files in host directory and child directories. Running html and python files
# will display the website and return values respectively. 



### GOAL:
* Serve a webpage using Flask.

### TASK:
As a trio...
1. In a new directory in your workshop, save a copy of the demo for using flask to serve static files.
1. As a team...
   - Familiarize yourself with the app directory structure and the files' content.
   - Note anything notable.
   - PREDICT expected behaviors.
   - "Spin up" your website on localhost and reconcile behavior with prediction.
   - Record notes in `readme` in app's root directory.
1. Once your team has done this, compose and store another html file named `fixie.html` (containing some html to render your team name and roster) so that flask can serve it staticly.
