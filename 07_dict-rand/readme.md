## The Snakes

### Names: Jake, Bogdan, Sean

### Discoveries
We relearned and discovered more about dictionaries in python. For example, we learned to use random.choice to pick a random pair in each of our sorted dictionaries. We also figured out how to sort the dictionaries regarding special characters using their ASCII values. 

### Concerns
We wonder if our criteria are too specific, since the second group is DUCKIENAME and special characters, which donâ€™t really correlate. 

### Questions
Could we have sorted using github handles instead?
